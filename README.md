# ImpactEvaluationTermPaper

This folder concerns my term paper for the Impact Evaluation and Causal Inference course at DSE.

The higher education environment in India is quite competitive and undergraduate colleges in the University of Delhi are routinely ranked the highest in the country. I have myself studied in top colleges of the country in both my undergraduate and postgraduate studies. Therefore, it appears interesting to find out whether a higher ranked college actually confers any benefit to its students, or if it is pure selection bias.

The DU admissions to UG colleges are based on cutoffs that solely rely on twelfth board scores. While the university has the information of registered students prior to admissions, there is no possible way to know who out of the registered students would seek admission to which of the 90 colleges under the university.

Therefore, the setting the cutoffs by individual colleges involves a great deal of guess work based on previous years' trends and recent achievements of the colleges that might attract students. Thus, there is a randomness involved in the assignment of colleges around the cutoff.

This appears to be a perfect case to apply regression continuity design to find the causal effect of going to a higher ranked college by cutoffs. However, the analysis is made complicated by affirmative action policies based on caste.

While the term paper is still being written, I have included here:

1. The entire code to be used once the data is availed (the data is yet to be availed) as a part of pre-registration

2. Additional code in the beginning, generating artificial data, based on a simple theoretical model of twelfth exam scores, and a demonstration of the code from point 1 on this data

I plan to make the theoretical model more realistic in the enar future.
